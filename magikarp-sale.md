### Static hosting shenanigans

> After struggling with the multiple static site sites and cdn providers out there I've decided to host
> this website in the github pages platform
> 
> 1. keybase seemed promissing but the kbpbot was not working and the support for fixing it wasn't there
> (from what I heard they have been focused on other products since they were acquired by Zoom)
> 1. fast.io service seemed good at first but refuses to render md/html or even index files without a premium account
> 
> So for now GitHub is clearly the winner, hit me up if you find simple static site web hosting with no fuss and TLS support.

### Long live the personal website

> This is my first iteration on having a personal website in maybe 10 years, so let's see how it pans out.
> 
> Hopefully I won't get bothered  with it and you will actually have something fun to see here.
